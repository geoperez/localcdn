# localcdn [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/70h3q73elu83chyr?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/geoperez/localcdn)

Local CDN is web server (running [EmbedIO](https://github.com/unosquare/embedio)) with an Api to download remote CDN resources like CSS and JS files and then host them directly in the local web server. The idea is provide an easy to setup full fallback for your webapp when you are not online or with slow connections.
